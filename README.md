Fire-Detection
Overview
Fire-Detection is a robust AI-powered solution designed for real-time fire detection using advanced computer vision techniques. This repository utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to accurately identify fire in various environments. The project aims to provide a reliable method for early fire detection to enhance safety and prevent fire-related disasters.

Features
Real-time Fire Detection: Leverages YOLO for high-speed, accurate fire detection.
Customizable Models: Adaptable to different environments and fire scenarios.
Easy Integration: Compatible with various systems for seamless deployment.
Alert System: Configurable to trigger alerts for immediate action.
Open Source: Encourages community contributions and improvements.
Installation
To set up the Fire-Detection project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Ramsha-18/ultralytics.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ultralytics/Fire-Detection
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the YOLOv8 model:

bash
Copy code
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov8/releases/download/v8.0/yolov8n.pt
Usage
You can use Fire-Detection both from the command line and within a Python environment.

Command Line Interface (CLI)
Run the YOLO model on an input video:

bash
Copy code
yolo predict model=yolov8n.pt source='path_to_video.mp4'
Python
Use the model in a Python script:

python
Copy code
import cv2
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the YOLOv8 model
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')

# Open the video file
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('path_to_video.mp4')

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Run YOLO inference
    results = model(frame)

    # Visualize results
    annotated_frame = results[0].plot()
    cv2.imshow('Fire Detection', annotated_frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
Model Training
To train the YOLO model on a custom dataset, follow the instructions below:

Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is annotated and organized in YOLO format.
Modify the configuration: Adjust the model and data configurations as required.
Train the model:
bash
Copy code
yolo train model=yolov8n.yaml data=your_dataset.yaml epochs=50
